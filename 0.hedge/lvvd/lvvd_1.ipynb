    "\n",
    "* BSM in 1973 uncertainty of price of underlying can be modeled by geometric Brownian motion process and a stochastic differential equation\n",
    "* $dS_t = \\mu S_tdt + \\sigma S_tdZ_t$\n",
    "* The risk factor to the option is a stock index paying no dividends\n",
    "* $S_t$: Index level at time t\n",
    "* $\\mu$: constant drift\n",
    "* $\\sigma$: instantaneous volatility\n",
    "* $Z_t$: Standard Brownian motion\n",
    "\n",
    "* In risk-neutral setting $\\mu$ is replaced by constant risk-less short-rate r\n",
    "* $dS_t = rS_tdt + \\sigma S_tdZ_t$\n",
    "* The index is assumed to be directly tradeable.\n",
    "* There is an risk-less bond that is also assumed to be directly tradeable \n",
    "* $dB_t = rB_tdt$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Price of vanilla European put option P with payoff $max[K - S_t,0]$ is determined by put-call parity:\n",
    "    * $P_t = C_t - S_t + e^{-r(T-t)}K$\n",
    "    \n",
    "* You can replicate this option payoff with a portfolio of the underlying index and a risk-less bond\n",
    "* The value of the option must equal the value of the payoff in order to avoid risk-less arbitrage\n",
    "* You can also discount back the risk-neutral expectation of the option payoff using the risk-neutral short rate\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dynamically trading the underlying index and a risk-less bond will allow us to delta hedge\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assuming trading at each discrete time interval t, profit-Loss for a given time interval $t$: \n",
    "    * $PL_{\\Delta t} \\approx \\frac {1}{2}\\Gamma * \\Delta S^2 + \\Theta * \\Delta t$\n",
    "    * $\\Gamma$: measures how option value changes with values in underlying index\n",
    "    * $\\Theta$: measures how option value changes with change in time $t$\n",
    "* PL of a given delta hedge is the difference between theoretical (ex ante) priced variance and realized variance during a hedging period\n",
    "* Variance futures and Variance Swaps (OTC) pay the holder the difference between a fixed variance strike and realized variance over period of time\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Notions of Volatility and Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "* Realized or Historical Volatility: Standard Deviations of log returns of financial time series\n",
    "* Instantaneous Volatility: volatility factor of a diffusion process\n",
    "* Implied Volatility: volatility that if you plug into BSM gives you the market observed price of option\n",
    " \n",
    "* These volatility factors have squared counterparts called variance\n",
    "* Annualized variance is the result of multiplying the variance by 252, the number of trading days in a year\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Volatility and Variance as an asset class\n",
    "\n",
    "* CBOE introduced the VIX in 1993\n",
    "* Currently VIX represents a 30-day variance swap rate\n",
    "\n",
    "* Trading in VIX futures began in 2004 \n",
    "* The first options on the index were introduced in 2006\n",
    "\n",
    "* In 2005 Eurex launched futures on VSTOXX volatility index, based on the EURO Stoxx 50\n",
    "* In 2009, relaunched as Mini futures contract and attracted significant liquidity due to financial crisis\n",
    "* After 2008, with volatility spiking, market participants became more sensitive to volatility risk \n",
    "* In 2010, options on VSTOXX index were created \n",
    "* In 2014, Eurex created variance futures contracts for EURO Stoxx 50\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Vol of Vol Indexes\n",
    "\n",
    "* VVIX and VVSTOXX\n",
    "* VVSTOXX: \n",
    "    * based on VSTOXX realtime options prices, reflect the near to long-term expectation of volatility of volatility\n",
    "    * Square root of implied variance across all options of a given time to expiration\n",
    "* Hedge options written on the volatility index itself \n",
    "* Vol of vol is usually higher than volatility\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Volatility and Variance Trading\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Vol Trading\n",
    "\n",
    "* Market expectation: VSTOXX represents 30-day implied vol average for out-of-the money options\n",
    "    * It is market consensus of to be realized volatility over the next 30-days\n",
    "* Non-tradeability: VSTOXX is not tradeable only derivatives can be traded\n",
    "* mean-reverting in nature, no positive/negative drift\n",
    "* negative correlation to its underlying index\n",
    "* positive jumps\n",
    "* VSTOXX is oftern higher than realized volatility\n",
    "\n",
    "* Long VSTOXX future\n",
    "    * used to hedge equity positions\n",
    "    * also used to hedge a short realized vol strategy\n",
    "* Short VSTOXX future\n",
    "    * Can be used to speculate reversion to mean after volatility spike\n",
    "    * Reduce vega exposure to long vega option portfolios\n",
    "* Term Structure Arbitrage\n",
    "    * If Contango: short front month and long the nearby future contract \n",
    "        * Possible if certain carries trades are available\n",
    "* Relative value arbitrage\n",
    "    * Trade against other variance and volatility instruments\n",
    "\n",
    "* VSTOXX Specific\n",
    "    * Since Options are European in nature, delta hedging is possible\n",
    "    * Long OTM Calls: market crash insurance\n",
    "    * Short ATM calls: If implied vol is high anf expecting mean reversion, you can write options and collect premium\n",
    "    * Long ATM Straddle: When VVOl is high buy puy-call with same ATM strike and maturity yields profit when VSTOXX moves fast enought in one direction\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Generally, contango/backwardation trades, expectation vs realized vol arbitrage\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Variance Trading\n",
    "\n",
    "* Long Variance Future: Realized variance is greater than expected variance \n",
    "    * Hedge Equity positions or Short Vega options\n",
    "* Short Variance Future: Realized Variance is lower than expected variance\n",
    "    * Hedge a long Vega options\n",
    "* Forward volatility/variance trading\n",
    "    * Gain exposure to foward implied volatility, short the front month variance future and long the nearby month \n",
